# PCM

This is PCM simulation. PCM stands for Pulse Code Modulation. This program takes an analog signal and convert's it to digital.
I am printing the first 11 points. These 11 points simulate one wavelength.
I print one wavelength of the analog sampled signal, then the quantized signal, the 1 and 0.
